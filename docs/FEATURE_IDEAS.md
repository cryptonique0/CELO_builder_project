# 🚀 High-Impact Feature Ideas

Prioritized ideas to grow contributions & showcase advanced dApp patterns.

## 🟢 Quick Wins (Hours)
- Network latency indicator (ping RPC, color code)
- Address book (localStorage) with ENS/Lookup placeholders
- CSV export for contract events
- UI theme toggle (light/dark/high-contrast)
- Inline ABI decoder for transaction input data

## ⚡ Medium (1–2 Days)
- Multi-wallet connector (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase)
- Transaction batching (multiple payWithMemo in one UX flow)
- Gas optimizer suggestion (compare speeds vs historical averages)
- Pending tx watcher overlay (floating panel)
- Mobile deep linking to wallet apps

## 🧠 Advanced (3–5 Days)
- Cross-chain balances (query multiple networks via RPC list)
- Subscription / recurring payments scheduler
- Off-chain indexing script (Node.js) to build richer analytics
- Signature-based meta-payments (relayer demo)
- Performance dashboard (charts: volume, fee spend, confirmations)

## 🛡 Security / Reliability
- Transaction simulation (dry-run using callStatic)
- Whitelist / approval limits manager for ERC-20
- Human-readable transaction preview (decode function + args)
- Rate limiting / spam protection UI hints

## 📦 Dev Tooling
- Hardhat task: bulk verification for multiple contracts
- Script: automatic ABI diff detector on commit
- CI job: gas report + trend artifact
- Test coverage badges workflow

## 🧪 Testing & QA
- Mock wallet provider for automated UI tests
- Error scenario triggers (forced revert, out of gas, wrong network)
- Snapshot testing of core UI components

## 🔌 Integrations
- GraphQL endpoint (hosted subgraph alternative prototype)
- Celo price oracle integration for USD cost display
- Explorer API usage metrics (pull live status of submitted tx hash)

## 🗂 Data & Persistence
- Local encrypted storage for address book & notes
- Event timeline heatmap
- Tagging system for transactions (e.g. marketing, payroll, donation)

## 🧩 Extensibility
- Plugin system (register custom panels)
- ABI upload + dynamic contract interaction workspace
